Summary -->
    Fetch mode JOIN is dominant over all cases. It does not honor any fetch type.

    In case of FetchMode: SELECT & SUBSELECT, FetchType is honoured which means we will not get Child
    Entity in lazy loading.

    Incase of FetchMode: SELECT & SUBSELECT, 2 select queries from product and category table. Even though
    JOIN would have run.
